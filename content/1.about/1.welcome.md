# docu[·]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}what?

__Docu[·]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}djeex__ is a site containing the documentation of my personal servers, originally created to easily keep track of my configurations and commands.  
My infrastructure is built around the Debian 12 + Docker combo, making exporting and deployment simpler.  
Special thanks to __Nipah__, __Xenio__, and others for their patience and support. Most of this content comes directly from them.
