# Samba

Samba is a protocol that allows access to a folder located on a network drive. It can be configured on macOS, Windows, or Linux.

There are many tutorials for setting up Samba on Windows or on NAS systems like Synology, but here we focus on Debian.

## Sharing a Network Folder

::alert{type="info"}
:::list{type="info"}
- In this example, we will share the `/video` folder from a remote machine called `remote-machine`. We will access this folder from a machine called `local-machine`. The user connecting to the network drive will be `sambauser`.
:::

### Install Samba Server

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install samba smbclient cifs-utils
```

### Create the `/video` Folder

```sh
sudo mkdir /video
```

### Configure the Share

Now, edit the file `/etc/samba/smb.conf`.

âœ¨ **Tip:** You can use [File Browser](/serveex/files/file-browser) to navigate and edit your files instead of using terminal commands.
\::

```sh
sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Find the `workgroup` variable, press `i` to enter insert mode, and name your workgroup (e.g., `workgroup = WORKGROUP`).

Then scroll to the end of the file and add the following configuration:

```properties
[video]
   comment = Video folder
   path = /video
   writable = yes
   guest ok = no
   valid users = @smbshare
   force create mode = 770
   force directory mode = 770
   inherit permissions = yes
```

Press `Esc` to exit insert mode, then type `:x` and press `Enter` to save and exit.

### Create a Samba User and Group

Since we're using a secured share, we need to create a user and group to access it remotely.

Create the group:

```sh
sudo groupadd smbshare
```

Give the group control over the `/video` folder:

```sh
sudo chgrp -R smbshare /video
```

Set inherited permissions:

```sh
sudo chmod 2775 /video
```

Now add a no-login user â€” this user cannot log into the server but can access Samba.

```sh
sudo useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin sambauser
```

Add the user to the `smbshare` group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG smbshare sambauser
```

Set a Samba password:

```sh
sudo smbpasswd -a sambauser
```

Enable the Samba account:

```sh
sudo smbpasswd -e sambauser
```

```sh
sudo ufw allow from remote-ip to any app Samba
::
```

## Accessing a Shared Folder

---

\::

### Install Required Packages

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install cifs-utils
```

### Create the Mount Destination

We will create a folder on our local machine where the remote `/video` folder will be mounted â€” e.g., `/mnt/video`.

```sh
sudo mkdir /mnt/video
```

### Prepare the .credentials File

To avoid typing our username and password every time, create a `.credentials` file storing the login info.

Create it in the `/smb` folder:

```sh
sudo mkdir /smb
sudo vi /smb/.credentials
```

Enter insert mode (`i`) and write:

```properties
username=smbuser
password=password
```

* `smbuser`: the user we created on the `remote-machine`
* `password`: the password set earlier

Press `Esc`, then `:x` and `Enter` to save and exit.

Set proper file permissions:

```sh
sudo chmod 600 /smb/.credentials
```

### Mount the Shared Folder

Now mount the folder:

```sh
sudo mount -t cifs -o credentials=/smb/.credentials //remote-ip/video /mnt/video
```

Replace `remote-ip` with your `remote-machine`'s IP address.

Verify the mount:

```sh
sudo mount -t cifs
```

Youâ€™ll see details confirming the mount is successful.

Now you can access the `/video` folder of the `remote-machine` from your `local-machine`!

### Auto-mount on Boot

By default, shares aren't auto-mounted after reboot. To automate this, edit the `/etc/fstab` file.

First, back it up:

```sh
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak
```

Then add the mount configuration line:

```sh
sudo echo //remote-ip/video    /mnt/video  cifs   _netdev,nofail,credentials=/smb/.credentials,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.device-timeout=15 0 0 >> /etc/fstab
```

Reboot the machine:

```sh
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, verify the mount:

```sh
sudo mount -t cifs
```

And done!

### Unmount the Shared Folder

```sh
sudo umount -t cifs /mnt/video
```
