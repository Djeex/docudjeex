# The ProloNAS

When you decide to dive into the adventure of running your own home server, the same questions usually come up: _“Where should I start?”_, _“Isn’t it expensive?”_. And often, people either give up or end up buying a proprietary NAS that they’ll throw away a year later once they realize it only brings headaches and wasted money.

A server isn’t a piece of furniture. It’s simply any computer capable of running Linux.That’s why mini PCs powered by **Intel N100** processors are so popular: for around $100–130 on Chinese platforms, you can get a machine that runs **24/7** for years, capable of handling everything you’d expect from a home server or personal cloud without sacrificing performance.

It’s **objectively inexpensive**, and anyone with a bit of curiosity can get started.

A mini PC for $100 + a USB dock for $50 that holds multiple hard drives = a complete platform for $150, versus **$350–1200** for branded NAS systems.

That’s all a **ProloNAS** is. It’s then up to you to scale your storage capacity according to your needs.

## Example Hardware

- Mini PC — **Note: choose 16 GB / 512 GB**: [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005008477986765.html)  
- DAS (Direct Attached Storage) — **Note: select “EU plug”**: [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005007933987260.html)  
- More refined alternative with a fan: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/Boîtier-Disque-Ventilateur-Supportant-Capacité/dp/B0DD3GSSCX)

## Why a NAS?

A **NAS** (Network Attached Storage) is a machine centered around storage, designed to be shared over a network.The idea is to have a **reliable and secure** storage space that serves as the backbone for your personal services and apps such as a self-hosted cloud like [Nextcloud](/serveex/cloud/nextcloud), a photo sync tool like [Immich](/serveex/cloud/immich), or a media server like [Plex](/serveex/media/plex). You can also store camera footage, backups, or even development projects on it.

### But why not just use a mini PC with an external hard drive?

Sure, a simple mini PC with 1–2 TB of storage will do for most people.And your movie collection might fit on an external drive of a few extra terabytes. But that’s **neither reliable nor scalable** a single shock or hardware failure could permanently destroy your data.

A real NAS is built around **storage reliability**. It uses redundancy strategies like [RAID](/general/storage/raid) to protect against drive failure, and snapshot systems like [ZFS](/general/storage/zfs) to guard against corruption.

In short, a NAS lets you **host everything yourself** that you currently entrust to third parties while maintaining control, reliability, and data safety.


## The Problem with Consumer NAS Systems

Many brands offer “ready-to-use” NAS platforms: Synology, QNAP, Ugreen, and others. They promise simplicity and sleek web interfaces, but the reality is quite different.

### First, the price.

$350 is the starting price for a 2-bay NAS (without drives) from Synology. For that, you get a 2019 processor, no SSD slot for the OS, and a measly 2 GB of RAM.

Now, compare that to the **ProloNAS**: an N100 (4 cores), 16 GB RAM, a 512 GB SSD for $100–130, plus a 4-bay DAS for $55. That’s **half the price** of a 2-bay Synology, and **a quarter of the price** of a 4-bay one.

### Locked-Down Operating Systems

“Yeah, but at least with a Synology, you plug it in and everything just works.”

One year.  
That’s how long it took before I threw away my Synology and realized I should have started with a **ProloNAS** (which later became a full-fledged server).

Manufacturers ship heavily customized Linux-based OSes: ancient kernels, limited app repositories, and complete dependence on their proprietary tools. As a result, you can’t fully tailor your NAS to your needs, and many Docker containers simply won’t run because the kernel is too old.

### Total Vendor Lock-In

“I’m fine with the built-in apps.”  
Yeah, I thought so too… until my needs exploded: media center, password manager, Git hosting, strong authentication, web hosting, and more.

Why stay stuck with half-baked proprietary tools when you can rely on **open-source projects** that are regularly updated and interoperable?

And what happens when the manufacturer decides to drop support or limit hardware compatibility? It’s already happened, Synology made certain drives **incompatible** unless they were “certified” by them. They even **disabled hardware transcoding** on their NAS units: [see here](https://www.cachem.fr/synology-desactive-transcodage-materiel-nas/).

In short, you have **no control** over a product that isn’t open, nor truly yours.

## OK, but how do I turn my Mini PC Serveex into a ProloNAS?

As mentioned earlier: by adding a **DAS (drive hub)** and setting up a redundant storage system with [RAID](/general/storage/raid) and [ZFS](/general/storage/zfs), you can transform your mini PC into a robust and scalable NAS.

Enjoy !
