A computer network cannot exist without the hardware required to build it. Hardware determines the size of the network, communication speeds, and its overall performance. In this article, we will focus on the simplest types of networks, typically found in home environments.

## The Router
---
The __router__ is the central hub of your network. It directs __packets__â€”the blocks of data that travel across your networkâ€”from the sender to the appropriate recipient. It manages the routing of data both within your local network and to/from external networks. In short, it enables devices to communicate with each other and with the internet.

Everyone has a router at homeâ€”it's the __internet box__ provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider).

In general, a router consists of:
- a WAN (Wide Area Network) port that receives data from the internet (or from a higher-level network). For example, it could be a port for a fiber optic connection from your ISP, or an SFP+/RJ45 port for a third-party router.
- a switch, i.e., a hub with several __LAN__ (Local Area Network) ports allowing multiple devices to connect to your network. These ports can be RJ45 or SFP/SFP+.
- sometimes a built-in WiFi transmitter/receiver.

A router may also include _firewall_ capabilities, allowing you to restrict traffic from specific devices, as well as _[NAT (Network Address Translation)](/general/networking/nat)_ for port forwarding. It generally includes a _[DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](/general/networking/nat#dhcp)_ server to automatically assign _IP addresses_ to devices connected to the network.

The router directly affects communication speeds between devices. The WAN port limits the maximum internet speed you can receive from your ISP. For example, if your subscription offers 5 Gb/s, youâ€™ll need a WAN port that supports at least 5 Gb/s. Likewise, internal device-to-device communication is limited by the speed of the switch. If your devices communicate at 5 Gb/s, the routerâ€™s switch must have 5 Gb/s ports. If you're using WiFi 7 equipment and want to enjoy its full speed, your router must support it as well. If youâ€™re using a separate WiFi access point, make sure its network port matches or exceeds the speed of the WiFi it broadcastsâ€”and that the router supports it too.

Internet speed, number of devices, WiFi speed, and internal network speedâ€”these are the four key factors to consider when choosing an internet box or buying your own router.

âœ¨ __Tip:__
You can easily use a third-party router to manage your network if your ISPâ€™s internet box supports _bridge mode_. In France, only the provider Free offers this option. It is technically possible with other providers that do not support bridge mode, but it can be quite difficult and may prevent you from using all the features a third-party router provides.

## The Switch
---

The __switch__, or network switch, is a device that allows multiple devices to connect to the network. It acts as a literal hub, connecting directly to the router or to another switch upstream. It helps avoid overloading the switch ports on your router or relocating devices to another room without running a cable from each one back to the router. Another common use case is to segment multiple networks that are managed by the same router.

There are generally two types of switches:
- **Unmanaged switches**, the most common. These are plug-and-play: you just plug them in and everything works automatically.
- **Managed switches**. These offer a configuration interface (via command line or web UI), allowing you to fine-tune routing rules under the control of the router. They are powerful for creating virtual networks between your devices, but usually require more setup time and are less convenient than simple unmanaged switches.

## Cables
---

Cables are essential components of your network. Depending on their type and category, they can limit the bandwidth between devices, so they must be chosen to match your network's specifications. They also need to be compatible with your devices' ports.

Hereâ€™s a quick reference of the most common cable and port standards:

- **RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000**: The standard RJ45 connector, supporting speeds from 10 Mbps (0.125 MB/s) to 1000 Mbps (125 MB/s)
- **RJ45 2.5G**: Same connector, supporting speeds up to 2.5 Gbps (312.5 MB/s)
- **RJ45 5G**: Same connector, supporting speeds up to 5 Gbps (625 MB/s)
- **RJ45 10GBase-T**: Same connector, supporting speeds up to 10 Gbps (1.25 GB/s)
- **SFP 1G**: SFP port, typically used for fiber optics, supporting up to 1 Gbps
- **SFP+ 10G**: Enhanced SFP port, also for fiber, supporting up to 10 Gbps

### Ethernet Cables

These copper cables usually use the standard `RJ45` connector. It's the most common network connector found on routers and switches.

Ethernet cables are divided into categories that define their maximum speed based on distance:

| Speed     | Cable Type | Max Distance |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 10 Gb/s   | CAT 6A     | 100 m        |
|           | CAT 6      | 55 m         |
|           | CAT 5e     | 30 m         |
| 5 Gb/s    | CAT 6      | 100 m        |
|           | CAT 5e     | 30 m         |
| 2.5 Gb/s  | CAT 5e     | 100 m        |
| 1 Gb/s    | CAT 5e     | 100 m        |
| 100 Mb/s  | CAT 5      | 100 m        |

Some of these cables are flat, round, shielded (requiring grounding), etc. Choose based on your setup. What matters is that, for example, if you want to connect a device with a 2.5 Gb/s RJ45 port to a 2.5 Gb/s router, youâ€™ll need at least a `CAT 5e` cable.

On the other hand, if your device is limited to 100 Mb/s, a simple `CAT 5` cable will suffice.

Nowadays, in new buildings, it is standard practice to install `CAT 6A` cables inside walls. This way, wall ports are ready to support 10 Gb/s over 100 meters.

### Optical Cables

Very thin but fragile, optical cables are increasingly appearing in home networks. It often starts with the fiber cable connecting your ISPâ€™s outlet to your box/router. They have several advantages:
- Extremely compact
- Zero electrical consumption (unlike copper, which loses energy as heat)
- No electromagnetic radiation (no shielding needed, no signal interference)
- Very high speeds over long distances

For local networking, it's important to understand that several types of fiber cables exist. Their performance depends on both distance and compatibility with the appropriate `transceiver`. Fiber cables connect to your devices' SFP+ ports via a small device called a transceiver, which converts electrical signals to light (and vice versa).

For local networks, the recommended standard is a **multimode OM3 fiber with LC connectors**, paired with a **10G LC SFP+ transceiver**. This setup allows 10 Gb/s connections and is compatible with most devices featuring SFP+ ports.

::alert{type="warning"}
:::list{type="warning"}
- __Warning:__ Make sure to use transceivers that are compatible with your devices (routers, switches, or other hardware). There is no universal standard yet, and manufacturers usually specify which brands are supported.

### DAC Cables

These are copper cables with integrated `transceivers`. They allow two SFP/SFP+ ports to communicate over short distances without using fragile fiber or RJ45 adapters. However, they consume more energy due to natural copper loss, which is non-negligible.

---

### SFP+ Transceivers

These let you connect different types of cables to your SFP/SFP+ ports. Variants are available for:
- Fiber optic
- DAC
- RJ45

::alert{type="warning"}
:::list{type="warning"}
- RJ45 transceivers consume a lot of energy due to copper signal loss and can generate significant heat. Low-power models (under 2W) exist and are generally rated for longer cables (e.g., 80m instead of 30m). Surprisingly, these are preferred over short-distance models because they generate less heat and consume less energyâ€”making them more compatible with sensitive devices. Using the wrong type can cause network degradation or even outages.
