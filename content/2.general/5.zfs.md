# ZFS

::alert{type="info"}
ðŸŽ¯ __Objectives:__
- Understand what ZFS is and why it's useful
::

ZFS is widely used in the world of servers, NAS systems (like FreeNAS / TrueNAS), virtualization, and even by tech-savvy individuals who want reliable storage. It is both a _file system_ (like NTFS for Windows, EXT4, FAT32, etc.) and a __volume manager__ (similar to LVM).

To put it simply:  
- A **volume manager** organizes physical storage (like one or more hard drives).  
- A **file system** organizes how data blocks are written, read, and deleted within those volumes.

ZFS goes far beyond traditional file systems in terms of performance and features.  
Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re most interested in:
- Its __snapshot management__ features, allowing you to quickly roll back in case of issues.
- Its support for disk groupings and [__RAID-like structures__](/global/RAID) (Z-Mirror, RAIDZ1, RAIDZ2, RAIDZ3).
- Its __automatic recovery of corrupted data__ (through scrubbing).
- Its performance, enhanced by RAM caching (ZFS ARC).
- Its robust error notifications and monitoring.

## Structure

![](/img/global/zfs.svg)

ZFS has a unique structure:

- **vdev** (virtual device): a group of physical or virtual disks.
- **zpool**: a collection of vdevs configured as a single storage pool. A zpool can contain multiple vdevs, but a vdev belongs to only one zpool.
- **dataset**: a logical data container within a zpool. Each dataset can have its own settings (compression, quotas, permissions, etc.).

There are several dataset types:
- **file system**: a standard ZFS filesystem, mounted without storage quotas.
- **zvol**: a "virtual disk" with a defined size, which you can format and partition as if it were a physical disk.
- **snapshot**: a frozen-in-time version of another dataset. Snapshots can be created manually or through backup tools. They can be mounted to browse data as it was at the snapshot time.

## Why ZFS over others?

### Data Integrity

ZFS continuously checks that your stored data hasn't become corrupted. Every block of data is associated with a checksum, allowing ZFS to detect even the smallest alteration. If corruption is found and a healthy copy exists elsewhere, ZFS can repair the data automatically.

### Built-in RAID

ZFS includes its own volume management system (vdevs). You can build a zpool using multiple disksâ€”similar to traditional [RAID](/global/RAID) setupsâ€”but with more flexibility. For example:
- **Z-mirror** â†’ equivalent to RAID 1
- **RAIDZ1** â†’ equivalent to RAID 5 (tolerates 1 disk failure)
- **RAIDZ2** â†’ equivalent to RAID 6 (tolerates 2 disk failures)
- **RAIDZ3** â†’ tolerates up to 3 disk failures

ZFS handles all this nativelyâ€”no external RAID software needed.

### Snapshots and Clones

ZFS allows you to create snapshotsâ€”instantaneous images of a dataset's state. Snapshots take up minimal space and can be scheduled frequently. You can also create clones: writable copies of snapshots.

### Compression and Deduplication

ZFS can compress data on the fly (transparently to the user), saving disk space. It also supports deduplication (removing duplicate data), though this feature requires a lot of memory and is not recommended for all use cases.

Now you know why ZFS is *the* file system to deploy on your NAS.
