  - Configure clients
  - Access the secure network

## Introduction
---
Using a VPN allows remote access to a serverâ€™s local resources without exposing them to the internet. Itâ€™s a clean and secure way to access services like SSH without exposing the port publicly. With a VPN, you can securely connect to your network from anywhere and make devices on different networks communicate.

Here we will use [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a secure and high-performance VPN server, using containers:

- [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy) as the server, providing a very simple web UI to manage connections and download config files (including QR codes for phones)
- [Wireguard](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-wireguard/?h=wireguard) as the client for Linux systems

Clients are also available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

The concept:

- On the internet, anyone can reach any internet box and thus any exposed server.
- Your server is on your local network. It is accessible only locally unless services are explicitly exposed (as we did with Dockge). To access non-exposed resources, you must be on the same local network.
- We want to securely access these unexposed services (like SSH) from anywhere.
- We also want to connect services between servers, like linking two Dockge instances securely.

To achieve this, weâ€™ll create a **Virtual Private Network** (VPN), i.e., a secure tunnel that only connected machines can use. Theyâ€™ll appear to be on the same private network.

Additionally, you can add your phone, laptop, or other devices to the VPN and securely access your server resources wherever you are.

In this diagram, machine 1 is part of two networks:

- Its local network (devices behind the same router, e.g. `192.168.x.x` â€“ machines 1 and 2)
- The VPN network (VPN devices with a second IP, e.g. `10.8.x.x` â€“ machines 1 and 4)

You *can* allow VPN clients to share access to their local networks, but we wonâ€™t do that here for security and subnet conflict reasons (e.g., if two remote machines use the same local IP like `192.168.1.1`).

So only VPN-connected devices can communicate with each other on the VPN, not with other local devices outside the VPN.

## Server Side

::alert{type="info"}
ðŸ“‹ __Checklist:__
- Ensure port `51820 UDP` is available and properly forwarded through your router to the server (`Source 51820 UDP -> Destination 51820 UDP -> Server`).
- Ensure port `51821 TCP` is available for the web UI.

- __Warning:__ This guide uses version `14` of [wg-easy](https://wg-easy.github.io/wg-easy/latest/). Version `15` introduces breaking changes incompatible with this configuration.

Folder structure:

```console
root
â””â”€â”€ docker
    â””â”€â”€ wg-easy
        â”œâ”€â”€ config
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ etc_wireguard
        â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml
        â””â”€â”€ .env
```

The container runs in `HOST` mode, meaning it uses the hostâ€™s network stack directly.

Open Dockge, click `compose`, and name the stack `wg_easy`.

Paste the following configuration:

```yaml
---
services:
  wg-easy:
    network_mode: host
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - LANG=en
      - WG_HOST=${HOST}
      - PASSWORD_HASH=${PW}
      - WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=${ADDRESS}
      - WG_HIDE_KEYS=never
      - WG_ALLOWED_IPS=${IPS}
      - WG_DEFAULT_DNS=
      - UI_TRAFFIC_STATS=true
      - UI_CHART_TYPE=1
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy:14
    container_name: wg-easy
    volumes:
      - /docker/wg_easy/config/etc_wireguard:/etc/wireguard
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
```

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ __Tip:__
- You can also specify your own wireguard port with `WG_PORT`
- Add the Watchtower label to enable automatic updates

```yaml
services
  wg-easy:
    #...
    labels:
      - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true
```
::

In `.env`:

```properties
HOST=
PW=
ADDRESS=
IPS=
```

| Variable     | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `HOST`       | Domain name of the host | `mydomain.com` |
| `PW`         | Bcrypt password hash, [generate here](https://bcrypt-generator.com/). **NOTE:** Double the `$` characters | `$$2a$$12$$FF6T4QqSP9Ho` |
| `ADDRESS`    | VPN DHCP address range, the `x` must remain, others can vary | `10.8.0.x` |
| `IPS`        | IPs routed by clients through the VPN. Use `10.8.0.0/24` to only route VPN traffic. To include local LAN, add `192.168.0.0/16` separated by commas. | `10.8.0.0/24` |

Deploy the stack.

### Enable Forwarding on Host

To allow communication between VPN clients, enable:

```shell
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
```

### Retrieve Configuration Files

To configure clients, download the config files from the server:

- Visit `http://your-server-ip:51821`
- Create a client
- Download the config file
- Rename it to `wg0.conf`

::alert{type="danger"}
:::list{type="danger"}
- If it fails, check firewall rules.
:::
::

## On the Client Server
---
::alert{type="info"}
:::list{type="info"}
- Assumes the client is a Linux server with Docker installed
:::
::

Folder structure:

```console
root
â””â”€â”€ docker
    â””â”€â”€ wireguard
        â””â”€â”€ config
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ wg_confs
        â””â”€â”€ compose.yaml
```

Create the folder `/docker/wireguard/config/wg_confs`:

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ __Tip:__ Use [File Browser](/serveex/files/file-browser) to browse and edit files without terminal
::

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /docker/wireguard/config/wg_confs
```

Copy the `wg0.conf` file downloaded earlier:

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ __Tip:__ Easiest way is to transfer the file via SFTP to `/home/youruser`, then move it:

```shell
sudo cp ~/wg0.conf /docker/wireguard/config/wg_confs
```
::

Create `compose.yaml` in `/docker/wireguard`:

```shell
sudo vi /docker/wireguard/compose.yaml
```

Press `i` to enter insert mode and paste:

```yaml
services:
  wireguard:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/wireguard:latest
    container_name: wireguard
    network_mode: host
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE #optional
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    volumes:
      - /docker/wireguard/config:/config
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules #optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Press `Esc` then type `:x` to save and exit.

Start the container:

```shell
cd /docker/wireguard
sudo docker compose up -d
```

::alert{type="info" icon="exclamation-circle"}
:::list{type="info"}
- Repeat for each client
:::
::

## Other Devices
---
- **Phone:** Install Wireguard and scan the QR code from the web UI (`http://your-server-ip:51821`)
- **PC:** Install the Wireguard client and import the config file

::alert{type="warning"}
:::list{type="warning"}
- __Warning:__ If a client device is on the same LAN as the server, edit `wg0.conf` and change the endpoint to the local server IP:
`Endpoint = your-server-ip:51820`
:::
::

And this is the result:
