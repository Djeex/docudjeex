Amateur photographer that I am, I spent several weeks looking for a framework with a photo gallery that could outshine Instagram. I wanted something that showcased the photos rather than the author, and that made every visit unique by loading the images in random order—while still allowing filtering and sorting by tag or combinations of tags.

In the end, I found nothing that did exactly what I wanted. And when something came close, it was always through heavy, bloated CMS platforms. So I decided to make a static site by hand, the old-school way, with Notepad++. Being fairly comfortable with HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript, I quickly came up with something nice during my vacation, between beach sessions. After all, a good craftsman should have good tools—and there’s no better tool than one you make yourself.

Then I thought it might be a good idea to automate certain tasks—like generating favicon formats, resizing and converting images, creating the gallery automatically instead of entering everything by hand, and generating `robots.txt` and `sitemap` files… so I turned back to Python.

Eventually, after getting good results, I figured I might as well go all the way: build a complete framework for generating a static site photo gallery, where all you need to do is fill in your site’s information in a config file and tweak the visuals a bit—without touching the code.

That’s how **Lum[eex]{style="color: #1ad6ff"}** was born.
